## Installation and Usage of Approved Version

To ensure you are using the reviewed and approved version of this tool, follow these installation steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url] playwright-mcp
    cd playwright-mcp
    ```
    *(Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL to the repository if it's hosted, or ensure you have the correct local copy.)*

2.  **Checkout the Approved Commit:**
    ```bash
    git checkout 54ed7c3200e7dc0596c3e70c31aa3cb5c037419d
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    npm run clean && npm run build
    ```

5.  **Configure in VS Code (or other MCP client):**
    When configuring this MCP server (e.g., in VS Code `settings.json`), ensure you point to the local `cli.js` file within your cloned and built repository.

    Example VS Code `settings.json` configuration:
    ```json
    {
        // ... other settings ...
        "mcp": {
            "servers": {
                // ... other mcp servers ...
                "playwright": {
                    "command": "npx",
                    "args": [
                        "[path_to_your_cloned_repo]/playwright-mcp/cli.js"
                        // Add any other necessary arguments here, e.g., --port, --browser
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        // ... other settings ...
    }
    ```
    Replace `[path_to_your_cloned_repo]` with the absolute path to where you cloned the `playwright-mcp` repository. For example, if you cloned it into `/Users/yourname/projects/`, the path would be `/Users/yourname/projects/playwright-mcp/cli.js`.
